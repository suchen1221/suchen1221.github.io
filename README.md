# Welcome to my personal website!
 
## About me
I am an incoming Associate Professor of Instruction in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science (SDS)](https://stat.utexas.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin)]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/)). Prior to joining the University of Texas, I was an Assistant Teaching Professor in the [Center for Transforming Data to Knowledge (D2K Lab)](https://d2k.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/).

I have extensive experience developing and teaching undergraduate courses in math, statistics and data science at multiple institutions including UT-Austin and [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html). During my time at Rice University, I have developed two courses that highlight experiential learning in Statistics and Data Science. I am passionate about curriculum development and pedagogical innovation, and helping students succeed.

I graduated with a PhD in Statistics at the UT-Austin, advised by [Prof. Stephen Walker](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/s.g.walker/). My doctoral research lies in the intersection of methodology, theory and computation of Bayesian statistics and their applications to high dimensional data analysis. 

I earned my Bachelor's of Science in Applied Math from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in China, and my Master's of Science in Math and Actuarial Science from UT-Austin. I am a certified actuary and has experience working in insurance and actuarial consulting firms before returning to academia.
